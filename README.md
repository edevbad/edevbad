Hi, I'm Ebad!

I'm a second-year Software Engineering student with a growing passion for JavaScript and web development. I'm constantly exploring new ways to create interactive, user-friendly web applications and building my skills as I learn more about front-end and back-end technologies.

- Currently learning: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and exploring frameworks like React
- Aspiring to learn: Full-stack development, Node.js, and other web technologies
- Ask me about: JavaScript basics, web development projects, or university life as a software engineering student
- How to reach me: ebadk205@gmail.com

Feel free to check out my repositories as I continue to learn and build projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something great together!
